# PELIB: My library for Project Euler

PRLIB is a library for [Project_Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). In project euler, several problems often share a common function, such as generating primes, combination or permutations ,and so on. So it is somehow important to conduct these common libraries together. And this is the original intenion of this project. Because the language I have already used for PE is frequently C++, this library is implemented by C++. May be I would move it to Python or Java in future, who knows.

## Dependency
Currently, the library is based on C++0x.

## Useful functions
